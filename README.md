# ML Challenge DISS - 2023

## Challenge organization:
* 9:45 - 10:45: Exploration of the data, Cleaning
* 10:45 - 11:15: Quick Presentation by the teams of what they observed in the data, what they cleaned, etc.
* 11:15 - 12:30: Work on Price prediction
* 12:30 - 13:00: Computation of the best score and presentation by 3 top teams

## Content
You have access to 2 files: 
* challenge_train is a dataset that you can use for training. It contains both features and target
* challenge_test contains only features. You must upload on Discord a csv file in which you fill the Price Column for this data.

## Results
For each file I receive, I will compute the **RMSE** score of price prediction, by comparing with the hidden ground truth. The 3 teams with the highest scores win the right to explain their method to the class!
